# Another C64 Emulator

I've growned up with the C64. It was my first computer and I spent many hours with it. Also years after that computer my love to it never ended.

For a deeper understanding of the C64 I always wanted to write an own C64 emulator. A second goal was to write it in portable language Java.

The most information I got from  https://www.c64-wiki.de/wiki. The most influence of the SW Design comes from https://github.com/marioballano/emudore . You will find many details from this implementation in my one. I made some own changes to it according to the wiki.
